                  Having ignited my passion for computer programming in early 2020, I have since been on a 
                  journey to hone my skills as a web developer. Since completing various courses such as CS50 from 
                  Harvard University and The Odin Project, I have created and develop numerous 
                  websites and applications. 

                  With experience using technologies such as NodeJS, ExpressJS, React as well as the bread 
                  and butter, HTML, CSS and Javascript - I strive to produce high performing, efficient and 
                  user friendly applications.
